Updated: Dec 2023 Page | 3 Section 1: Introduction Importance of Learning Mathematics Primary Mathematics Curriculum Key Focus Areas Updated: Dec 2023 Page | 4 1. INTRODUCTION Importance of Learning Mathematics Mathematics contributes to the development and understanding in many disciplines and provides the foundation for many of today’s innovations and tomorrow’s solutions. It also underpins many aspects of our everyday activities, from making sense of information around us to making informed decisions about personal finances. Primary Mathematics Curriculum Primary education is a stage where students acquire important basic numeracy as well as develop logical reasoning and problem-solving skills that are required in many disciplines. It lays the foundation for the learning of mathematics for all students, equipping them with a tool for everyday life and the knowledge and skills for learning mathematics at the next level. It is also a stage where students’ confidence and interest in the subject are built and their attitudes towards the discipline are shaped. For these reasons, the Primary Mathematics Syllabus aims to enable all students to: • acquire mathematical concepts and skills for everyday use and continuous learning in mathematics; • develop thinking, reasoning, communication, application and metacognitive skills through a mathematical approach to problem solving; and • build confidence and foster interest in mathematics. The Primary Mathematics Syllabus assumes no formal learning of mathematics. However, early numeracy skills such as matching, counting, sorting, comparing and recognising simple patterns are useful in providing a good grounding for students to begin learning at Primary 1 (P1). The P1-4 syllabus is common to all students. The P5-6 Standard Mathematics syllabus continues the development of the P1-4 syllabus whereas the P5-6 Foundation Mathematics syllabus re-visits some of the important concepts and skills in the P1-4 syllabus. The new concepts and skills introduced in Foundation Mathematics is a subset of the Standard Mathematics syllabus. Updated: Dec 2023 Page | 5 Key Focus Areas The previous syllabus emphasised the development of critical mathematical processes such as reasoning and communication. It made explicit the learning experiences that students should have in the course of learning because how students experience the learning of mathematics is critical in the development of these processes. The revised syllabus builds on this effort to further improve the teaching and learning of mathematics at the primary level and to ensure that the curriculum remains relevant and continues to prepare students well for learning of mathematics at the secondary level. Key focus areas of this revised syllabus: 1. Continue to develop critical mathematical processes that support the development of 21st century competencies; 2. Develop a greater awareness of the big ideas in mathematics that will deepen students’ understanding and appreciation of mathematics; and 3. Give greater emphasis to the development of metacognition to promote self-directed learning and reflection. Updated: Dec 2023 Page | 6 Updated: Dec 2023 Page | 7 Section 2: Mathematics Curriculum Nature of Mathematics Themes and Big Ideas Mathematics Curriculum Framework 21 st Century Competencies Updated: Dec 2023 Page | 8 2. MATHEMATICS CURRICULUM Nature of Mathematics Mathematics can be described as a study of the properties, relationships, operations, algorithms, and applications of numbers and spaces at the very basic levels, and of abstract objects and concepts at the more advanced levels. Mathematical objects and concepts, and related knowledge and methods, are products of insight, logical reasoning and creative thinking, and are often inspired by problems that seek solutions. Abstractions are what make mathematics a powerful tool for solving problems. Mathematics provides within itself a language for representing and communicating the ideas and results of the discipline. Themes and Big Ideas From the above description of the nature of mathematics, four recurring themes in the study of mathematics are derived. How can the mathematical objects be further abstracted and where can they be applied? How can the mathematical objects and concepts be represented and communicated within and beyond the discipline? What are the properties of mathematical objects and how are they related? What meaningful actions can we perform on the mathematical objects and how do we carry them out? Updated: Dec 2023 Page | 9 1. Properties and Relationships: What are the properties of mathematical objects and how are they related? Properties of mathematical objects (e.g. numbers, lines, figures etc.) are either inherent in their definitions (e.g. geometrical properties of shapes) or derived through logical argument and rigorous proof. Relationships exist between mathematical objects. They include the proportional relationship between two quantities and the equivalence of two expressions or statements. Understanding properties and relationships enable us to gain deeper insights into the mathematical objects and use them to model and solve real-world problems. 2. Operations and Algorithms: What meaningful actions can we perform on the mathematical objects and how do we carry them out? Operations are meaningful actions performed on mathematical objects. They include arithmetic operations, algebraic manipulations, geometric transformations and many more. Algorithms are generalised sequences of well-defined smaller steps to perform a mathematical operation or to solve a problem. Some examples are adding or multiplying two numbers and finding factors and multiples. Understanding the meaning of these operations and algorithms and how to carry them out enable us to solve problems mathematically. 3. Representations and Communications: How can the mathematical objects and concepts be represented and communicated within and beyond the discipline? Representations are integral to the language of mathematics. They include symbols, notations, and diagrams such as tables, graphs, charts and geometrical figures that are used to express mathematical concepts, properties and operations in a way that is precise and universally understood. Communication of mathematics is necessary for the understanding and dissemination of knowledge within the community of practitioners as well as general public. It includes clear presentation of mathematical statements as well as choosing appropriate representations (e.g. list, chart, drawing) to communicate mathematical ideas that can be understood by the masses. Updated: Dec 2023 Page | 10 4. Abstractions and Applications: How can the mathematical objects be further abstracted and where can they be applied? Abstraction is at the core of mathematical thinking. Working with numbers without units is an example of abstraction. The processes of abstraction make visible the structure and rich connections within mathematics and makes mathematics a powerful tool. Application of mathematics is made possible by abstractions. From simple counting to complex modelling, the abstract mathematical objects, properties, operations, relationships and representations can be used to model and study real-world phenomena. Big ideas express ideas that are central to mathematics. They appear in different topics and strands. There is a continuation of the ideas across levels. They bring coherence and show connections across different topics, strands and levels. The big ideas in mathematics could be about one or more themes, that is, it could be about properties and relationships of mathematical objects and concepts and the operations and algorithms involving these objects and concepts, or it could be about abstractions and applications alone. Understanding the big ideas brings one closer to appreciating the nature of mathematics. Six clusters of big ideas are listed in this syllabus. These are not meant to be authoritative or comprehensive. They relate to the four themes that cut across and connect concepts from the different content strands, and some big ideas extend across and connect more concepts than others. Each cluster of big ideas is represented by a label e.g. big ideas about Equivalence, big ideas about Proportionality, etc. Updated: Dec 2023 Page | 11 Big Ideas about Equivalence Main Themes: Properties and Relationships, Operations and Algorithms Equivalence is a relationship that expresses the ‘equality’ of two mathematical objects that may be represented in two different forms. The conversion from one form to another equivalent form is the basis of many manipulations for analysing, comparing, and finding solutions. In every statement about equivalence, there is a mathematical object (e.g. a number, an expression or an equation) and an equivalence criterion (e.g. value(s) or part-whole relationships). Big Ideas about Diagrams Main Themes: Representations and Communications Diagrams are succinct, visual representations of real-world or mathematical objects that serve to communicate properties of the objects and facilitate problem solving. Understanding what different diagrams represent, their features and conventions, and how they are constructed help to facilitate the study and communication of important mathematical results. Big Ideas about Invariance Main Themes: Properties and Relationships, Operations and Algorithms Invariance refers to a property of a mathematical object which remains unchanged when the object undergoes some form of transformation. Many mathematical results are about invariance. These are sometimes expressed as a general property of a class of objects. In each instance, there is a mathematical object (e.g. a sequence of numbers, a geometrical figure or a set of numerical data), there is an action (e.g. re-arrangement or manipulation), and there is a property of the mathematical object that does not change. Updated: Dec 2023 Page | 12 Big Ideas about Measures Main Themes: Abstractions and Applications Numbers are used as measures to quantify a property of real-world or mathematical objects so that these properties can be analysed, compared and ordered. Many measures have units. Zero means the absence of the property in most cases. Special values such as one unit serve as useful reference. Some measures are governed by certain formula, e.g. area = length × breadth. Big Ideas about Notations Main Themes: Representations and Communications Notations represent mathematical objects, their operations and relationships symbolically. They are written in a concise and precise manner that can be understood by users of mathematics. These form a writing system that facilitates the communication of mathematical ideas. Understanding the meaning of mathematical notations and how they are used, including the rules and conventions, help to facilitate the study and communication of important mathematical results, properties and relationships, reasoning and problem solving. Big Ideas about Proportionality Main Themes: Properties and Relationships Proportionality is a relationship between two quantities that allows one quantity to be computed from the other based on multiplicative reasoning. Proportionality is common in many everyday applications of mathematics. Problems involving fractions, ratios, rates and percentages often require the use of proportionality. Underlying the concept of proportionality are two quantities that vary in such a way that the ratio between them remains the same. Updated: Dec 2023 Page | 13 Mathematics Curriculum Framework The central focus of the mathematics curriculum is the development of mathematical problem-solving competency. Supporting this focus are five inter-related components – concepts, skills, processes, metacognition and attitudes. Mathematical Problem Solving Problems may come from everyday contexts or future work situations, in other areas of study, or within mathematics itself. They include straightforward and routine tasks that require selection and application of the appropriate concepts and skills, as well as complex and non-routine tasks that requires deeper insights, logical reasoning and creative thinking. General problem-solving strategies, e.g. Pólya’s 4 steps to problem solving and the use of heuristics, are important in helping one tackle non-routine tasks systematically and effectively. Mathematics Curriculum Framework Concepts The understanding of mathematical concepts, their properties and relationships and the related operations and algorithms, are essential for solving problems. Concepts are organised by strands, and these concepts are connected and inter-related. In the primary mathematics curriculum, concepts in numbers, algebra, measurement, geometry and statistics are explored. Belief, appreciation, confidence, motivation, interest and perseverance Awareness, monitoring and regulation of thought processes Competencies in abstracting and reasoning, representing and communicating, applying and modelling Proficiency in carrying out operations and algorithms, visualising space, handling data and using mathematical tools Understanding of the properties and relationships, operations and algorithms Updated: Dec 2023 Page | 14 Skills Being proficient in carrying out the mathematical operations and algorithms, visualising space, handling data and using mathematical tools is essential for solving problems. In primary mathematics, numerical calculation, algebraic manipulation, spatial visualisation, data analysis, measurement, use of mathematical tools and estimation are explicitly taught. Processes Mathematical processes refer to the practices of mathematicians and users of mathematics that are important for one to solve problems and build new knowledge. These include abstracting, reasoning, representing and communicating, applying and modelling. Abstraction is what makes mathematics powerful and applicable. Justifying a result, deriving new results and generalising patterns involve reasoning. Expressing one’s ideas, solutions and arguments to different audiences involves representing and communicating, and using the notations (symbols and conventions of writing) that are part of the mathematics language. Applying mathematics to real-world problems often involves modelling 2 , where reasonable assumptions and simplifications are made so that problems can be formulated mathematically, and where mathematical solutions are interpreted and evaluated in the context of the real-world problem. Metacognition Metacognition, or thinking about thinking, refers to the awareness of, and the ability to control one's thinking processes, in particular the selection and use of problem-solving strategies. It includes monitoring and regulation of one's own thinking and learning. It also includes the awareness of one’s affective responses towards a problem. When one is engaged in solving a non-routine or open-ended problem, metacognition is required. Attitudes Having positive attitudes towards mathematics contributes to one’s disposition and inclination towards using mathematics to solve problems. Attitudes include one’s belief and appreciation of the value of mathematics, one’s confidence and motivation in using mathematics, and one’s interests and perseverance to solve problems using mathematics. 2 Students are exposed to mathematical modelling at the secondary level. At the primary level, students should be exposed to real-world problems, where they have to formulate the problems mathematically and check the reasonableness of answers in the context of the problems. These are important skills and habits that will support mathematical modelling at the secondary level. Updated: Dec 2023 Page | 15 Mathematics and 21st Century Competencies The learning of mathematics creates opportunities for students to develop key competencies that are important in the 21st century, in particular, Critical, Adaptive and Inventive Thinking. For example, when students pose questions, justify claims, and write and critique mathematical explanations and arguments, they are engaged in not only mathematical reasoning, but also critical thinking. When students devise different strategies to solve an open-ended problem or formulate different mathematical models to represent a real-world problem, they are engaged in inventive thinking. When students vary their approaches to solve different but related problems , they are engaged in adaptive thinking. As an overarching approach, the primary mathematics curriculum supports the development of 21st century competencies (21CC) in the following ways: 1. The content is relevant to the needs of the 21st century. They provide the foundation for learning many of the advanced applications of mathematics that are relevant to today’s world. 2. The pedagogies create opportunities for students to think critically, adaptively and inventively, reason logically and communicate effectively using mathematics, work individually as well as in groups, using ICT tools where appropriate in learning and doing mathematics. 3. The problem contexts raise students’ awareness of local and global issues around them. For example, problems involving savings, donations, waste reduction, sustainability etc. create opportunities for discussion of local and global issues around them. Updated: Dec 2023 Page | 16 Updated: Dec 2023 Page | 17 Section 3: Pedagogy Teaching Processes Phases of Learning Addressing the Focus Areas and Framework Use of Technology Updated: Dec 2023 Page | 18 3. PEDAGOGY Teaching Processes The Singapore Teaching Practice (STP) explicates a set of Pedagogical Practices (PP) that comprise four fundamental Teaching Processes that lie at the heart of good teaching. The four Teaching Processes are presented below: Updated: Dec 2023 Page | 19 Phases of Learning The Teaching Areas of the STP could be drawn on to plan and deliver effective lessons using the three phases of learning − Readiness, Engagement and Mastery − reflected below. Readiness Phase Student readiness to learn is vital to success in learning. Teachers have to consider the learning environment, students’ profile, students’ prior and pre-requisite knowledge, and motivating contexts that will interest students. Engagement Phase This is the main phase of learning where students engage with the new materials to be learnt (Encouraging Learner Engagement). As students have diverse learning needs and bring with them a wide range of experiences, beliefs, knowledge and skills, it is important to consider the pace of the learning and transitions (Pacing and Maintaining Momentum) using a repertoire of pedagogies. Three pedagogical approaches form the spine that supports most of the mathematics instruction in the classroom. They are not mutually exclusive and could be used in different parts of a lesson or unit. Teachers make deliberate choices on the instructional strategies (Deciding on Instructional Strategies) based on learners’ profiles and needs, and the nature of the concepts to be taught. The engagement phase can include one or more of the following: • Activity-based Learning • Inquiry-based Learning • Direct Instruction Regardless of the approach, it is important for teachers to plan ahead, anticipate students’ responses, and adapt the lesson accordingly (Exercising Flexibility). Updated: Dec 2023 Page | 20 Mastery Phase The mastery phase is the final phase of learning where students consolidate and extend their learning. To consolidate, teachers summarise and review key learning points at the end of a lesson and make connections with the subsequent lesson (Concluding the Lesson). The mastery phase can include one or more of the following: • Motivated Practice • Reflective Review • Extended Learning Addressing the Focus Areas and Framework General Approach Developing problem-solving skills requires attention to all five components of the framework. Even though there are many facts and procedures in mathematics, where automaticity and fluency are important, there must be emphasis on conceptual understanding and problem solving, where reasoning and strategic thinking are important. Therefore, an overarching pedagogical approach that promotes relational understanding over instrumental understanding (Skemp, 1976) 3 is advocated. This means knowing the why, not just the what and how. A focus on relational understanding benefits all students as it helps students apply facts and procedures more skilfully, improve their problem- solving strategies and it deepens their appreciation of the nature of mathematics. Teaching towards Big Ideas One of the foci of this syllabus is to develop a greater awareness of the nature of mathematics. To do so, the big ideas that are central to the discipline and bring coherence and connection between different topics should be discussed. This requires teachers to teach towards big ideas, where they help students see and make connections among mathematical ideas within a topic, or between topics across levels or strands. An understanding of big ideas can help students develop a deeper and more robust understanding of mathematics and better appreciation of the discipline. Use of Technology Teachers should consider the affordance of ICT to help students learn. As the ability to use ICT effectively is part of the 21 st century competencies, teachers should provide 3 Skemp, R. R. (1976). Relational understanding and instrumental understanding. Mathematics Teaching, 77, 20-26. Updated: Dec 2023 Page | 21 opportunities for students to use ICT tools to understand mathematical concepts through visualisations, simulations and representations. ICT can support exploration, experimentation and extend the range of problems accessible to students. Students can also use ICT to communicate ideas and collaborate with one another as part of the knowledge building process while teachers can assess learning and provide feedback in a timely manner. e-Pedagogy is the practice of teaching with technology for active learning that creates a participatory, connected and reflective classroom to nurture the future-ready learner. Updated: Dec 2023 Page | 22 Updated: Dec 2023 Page | 23 Section 4: Assessment Formative Assessment Summative Assessment Updated: Dec 2023 Page | 24 4. ASSESSMENT Assessment is an integral part of the teaching and learning process. A balanced assessment system includes both summative and formative assessments. While it is essential to know how competent a student is at a certain point of learning, it is just as important to monitor the student’s learning and involve him or her in peer or self-assessment as part of the learning process (Huinker & Freckmann, 2009) 4 . An assessment system that solely relies on summative assessment will lead to teaching that is overly focused on assessment. This will restrict the learning opportunities for students thus affecting their motivation for learning. Formative Assessment Formative assessment provides information on how well students are progressing toward the desired learning goal(s). Why assess? The purpose of formative assessment is to help students improve their learning and be self-directed in their learning. In the learning of mathematics, just as in other subjects, information about students’ understanding of the content must be gathered before, during and after the lesson. For teachers, this information should inform the starting point of teaching, the development of the concepts, and the remedial actions that may be necessary. For students, formative assessment informs them of their specific areas of strengths and weaknesses. What to assess? The outcomes of the mathematics curriculum go beyond just the recall of mathematical concepts and skills. Since mathematical problem solving is the focus of the mathematics curriculum, assessment should also focus on students’ understanding and ability to apply what they know to solve problems. In addition, there should be emphasis on processes such as reasoning and communicating. 4 Huinker, D., & Freckmann, J. (2009). Linking principles of formative assessment to classroom practice. Wisconsin Teacher of Mathematics, 60(2), 6-11. Updated: Dec 2023 Page | 25 The overarching objectives of assessment should focus on students’: • understanding of mathematical concepts (going beyond simple recall of facts); • ability to reason, communicate, and make meaningful connections and integrate ideas across topics; • ability to formulate, represent and solve problems within mathematics and to interpret mathematical solutions in the context of the problems; and • ability to develop strategies to solve non-routine problems. In addition, teachers must be mindful of the impact of assessment on students’ self-belief about their ability and confidence. It is therefore important that assessment be pitched appropriately to develop positive attitudes towards the learning of mathematics. How to assess? The process of assessment must be embedded in the planning of the lessons. Various teaching actions can be integrated into classroom instruction to help teachers to check if learning is taking place as intended, and how students can build on past knowledge and experiences to move forward in their learning. The embedding of assessment process may take the following forms: • Diagnostic Assessment. Mathematics consists of concepts and skills that are arranged in a largely hierarchical manner. Progress in mathematics learning is dependent on the mastery of pre-requisite concepts and skills. For each mathematics lesson prior to learning new concepts, teachers need to set aside some time to conduct diagnostic assessment such as a short quiz (verbal or written) or use diagnostic tests to draw out students’ prior knowledge of the content and related concepts required for the lesson. This allows teachers to build on the preconceptions the students bring with them to the classroom. Appropriate use of these tests can help teachers identify gaps and difficulties in learning and provide useful information for focused instruction and remediation strategy. • Class Activities. Teachers can elicit evidence of students’ learning through class activities. For example, teachers may observe how students solve problems required in the activities and get them to explain their strategies. Teachers can also engage students in assessing their own work and reflecting on their own learning and how to improve it. In addition, teachers can use different examples of work produced by students for class discussion, to help students to understand different standards of work and how students can work towards producing work of better quality next time. Updated: Dec 2023 Page | 26 • Classroom Discourse. Getting students to share their thoughts and their ideas creates teachable moments for teachers to correct a misconception, provide feedback, reinforce a learning point or expand on an idea. Such discourse, facilitated by effective questioning and the use of talk moves, provides opportunities to probe and assess students’ understanding of the concepts and skills. In the process, students also learn to articulate their thinking and deepen their understanding, and develop confidence in talking about mathematics and using it. • Individual or Group Tasks. Teachers can assign mathematical tasks for students to work on individually or as a group. These tasks require students to apply their knowledge and skills in context, giving focus to mathematical processes. A rubric is useful to indicate what is expected of students in terms of processes and quality of work. It is important that students have an idea of where they stand in relation to the lesson objectives, so that they can chart and take ownership of their progress. The rubric also provides a structured means of giving qualitative feedback. Teachers can consider getting students to assess their own performances so that students can reflect on their work and make improvements. Assessment provides feedback for both students and teachers. The following are considerations for the different types of feedback between teachers and students and among students: • Feedback from teachers to students must inform students where they are in their learning and what they need to do to improve their learning. They must be timely and should focus on both strengths and weaknesses of the work done. Additionally, feedback should include ideas on how students can move forward in their learning. • Feedback from students to teachers comes from their responses to the assessment tasks designed by teachers. They provide information to teachers on what they need to do to address learning gaps, how to modify the learning activities students engage in, and how they should improve their instruction. Teachers should design their assessment tasks carefully in order to elicit the relevant information from their students. • Feedback between students is important as well because peer-assessment is useful in promoting active learning. It provides an opportunity for students to learn from each other and also allows them to develop an understanding of what counts as quality work by critiquing their peers’ work in relation to a particular learning outcome. The abovementioned teaching actions are not exhaustive. Ultimately, the choice must be guided by its purpose, that is, assessment must be fit-for-purpose. Teachers need to be very clear about what they want students to learn, how students should learn, and decide how best to assess, and what assessment strategies are suitable to gather information about students’ learning. Updated: Dec 2023 Page | 27 Summative Assessment Summative assessment gathers information on students’ attainment and progress at the end of instruction. It is usually conducted at critical points of students’ learning across a range of activities that are associated with tests. Why assess? The purpose of summative assessments, such as tests and examinations, is to measure the extent to which students have achieved the learning objectives of the syllabuses. As the results of these assessments are used for making decisions such as progression, it is important that these assessments are pitched appropriately and consistently to provide accurate information about students’ achievements. • For students, the information gives them a sense of the overall level of mastery as well as an indicator of progress. The marks and grades show the levels of their achievement. • For teachers, the information gives them a sense of the overall performance of the class as a whole as well as of the students as individuals. Considering the profiles of the students, the information provides evidence of the overall effectiveness of teaching. • For school leaders, the information gives them a sense of the overall performance of the cohort as well as of the individual classes. The information is useful for planning and decision-making (e.g., curriculum revision) within the school. The information of individual students’ achievement will also be used to make decisions such as awards, promotion, placement, remediation, etc. • For parents, the information gives them a sense of their children’s achievement and progress and helps them take specific actions to ensure the children’s progress in learning. What to assess? Summative assessment assesses the extent to which students have achieved the learning outcomes specified in the syllabus. The learning outcomes cover mathematical concepts, skills and processes in the syllabus. It may also assess the learning outcomes from the previous year that support current learning. All summative assessment must be appropriately pitched according to the syllabus. Otherwise, the information gathered from the assessment will lead to wrong conclusion about the students’ mastery level and teachers’ teaching effectiveness. It may also cause unwarranted psychological responses. For example, above-level testing may result in loss of motivation for learning, anxiety and work avoidance amongst students. Updated: Dec 2023 Page | 28 How to assess? Summative assessments usually take the form of pen-and-paper tests. All summative assessment should have a Table of Specification (TOS). The TOS gives the relative distribution of the topics to be assessed and the cognitive levels of the items. While it is not possible to assess all learning objectives, having each topic weighting indicated in the TOS will help to ensure no topics is overly assessed in the same test paper. Tests that focus on a few topics and exclude other important content, will not be able to accurately assess students’ mastery of the subject. A well-designed TOS not only helps to support teachers’ professional judgment when setting a test, but also help them in making clear connections between planning, instruction and assessment (Fives, Helenrose & Nicole, 2013) 5 . The overall difficulty level of the paper must be carefully planned, with an appropriate distribution of easy, moderate and difficult items. An appropriately pitched paper allows students to experience success and gives a fair reflection of the effectiveness of teaching and learning. While pen-and-paper tests are useful, there is value in exploring a wider variety of assessment methods and strategies, in particular, those that will allow teachers to gather information that is not easily available through such tests but are valuable in supporting learning. 5 Fives, Helenrose & DiDonato-Barnes, Nicole (2013).
