-- Complete database setup script for Math Problem Generator
-- This script creates the full schema with all features including difficulty levels and problem types

-- Drop existing tables if they exist (use with caution in production)
-- DROP TABLE IF EXISTS math_problem_submissions CASCADE;
-- DROP TABLE IF EXISTS math_problem_sessions CASCADE;

-- Create math_problem_sessions table with all features

-- In production, you would want more restrictive policies

-- Allow anonymous users to read and insert math_problem_sessions
